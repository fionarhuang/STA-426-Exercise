```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Sampling

This is to sample 1000 values from a log-normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.25 

```{r sample}
x<-rlnorm(1000,meanlog = 1,sdlog = 0.25)

```

## Plots

To see how the distribution look like, a histogram of the sample is plotted as below.

```{r plot1, echo=TRUE}
hist(x,breaks = 50,main="Histogram of sample")
```

The sample has mean `r round(mean(x),3) ` and variance `r round(var(x), 3)`.

```{r plot2, echo=TRUE}
hist(log(x),breaks = 50,main="Histogram of sample in log scale")

```

 After log-transformation, the transformed sample has mean `r round(mean(log(x)),3) ` and variance `r round(var(log(x)), 3)`.
